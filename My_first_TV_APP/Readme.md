#Live News App:
This newly developed App is an application for smart television (TV)/ Android TV that streams some live news that is already available on YouTube. 
Typing, for the selection of e.g. a favorite channel on a smart TV, using a remote control can be a tedious job. Therefore to make this job easy, this app uses intents for providing a fast and convenient way to stream news channels on YouTube. With just a few clicks, users can easily access and watch their favorite live news broadcasts without having to struggle while typing using the TV's remote control.\ This app is written in Programming Language Java using Android Studio as an Integrated Development Environment. \ This app uses explicit intents to stream Live YouTube news channels. This app has a grid layout.
